## SJFIT.Ai

### Overview:
SJFit.Ai was designed for San Jose State University Students and anybody who wants a fit lifestyle. In short, this application tracks the physical activity that the user does. We can track the angles of joints by implementing APIs such; as MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Artificial Intelligence, allowing us to count the number of repetitions the user has done thus far in their workout set.

### Workouts:
So far, our program allows for users to track squats, arm curls, and shoulder presses. We are still working on more exercises so look forward to that!

### Installation:
To get this working, Download the files and run on Jupyter Notebook/Labs. It is highly encouraged to use this on a windows device. The Jupyter Notebook website has an installation process on their website if you do not have that installed.
