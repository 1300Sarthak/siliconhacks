## SJFIT.Ai

### Overview:
SJFit.Ai was designed for San Jose State University Students and anybody that wants to have a fit lifestyle. In short, this application tracks physical activity that the user does. Through the implementation of APIs such; MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Artificial Intelligence we are able to track the angles of joints, allowing us to count the number of repetitions the user has done thus far in their workout set. 

### Workouts:
So far, our program allows for users to track squats, arm curls, and shoulder presses. We are still working on more exercises so look forward to that!

### Installation:
To get this working, Download the files and run on Jupyter Notebook/Labs. It is highly encouraged to use this on a windows device. The Jupyter Notebook website has an installation process on their website if you do not have that installed.
